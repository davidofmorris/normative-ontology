# A normative ontology
This ontology offers a framework for understanding existence and our participation in reality through the lens of information theory. By expressing ancient wisdom about consciousness and identity in modern theoretical terms, it creates conceptual clarity that helps us find coherence across diverse modes of thought. This clarity in turn allows us to respond to the varied contexts of life with consistency and purposeful intent.

## Normative
This ontology is normative in that it expresses the natural perspective of non-duality common to most people throughout history, in a modern information theoretic framework.

## Discreteness
There are no continuums in nature. The platonic representations of continuous things like lines and circles are expressed in language, and the images in our minds that come in response to these ideals are also discrete in nature.

## Determinism
Because reality is closed and discrete, it is natural and practical to grant determinism. Further, there is nothing in the human experience that contradicts determinism.

## The information substrate
Reality is an information substrate that can be pictured as a graph rewrite system.

## The ontological ruleset
The purpose of reality is encoded into a ruleset expressed in terms of patterns and rewrite rules.

## The first identity
The first point added to the substrate is the first identity. The ruleset recognizes patterns of identity across scales and emergent substrates. Identity is a fundamental structural metaphor of reality.

## The spatial mesh
Information representing locations in three spatial dimensions expanded out from the first identity and became its embodiment.

## Awareness is transformation
All feelings and awareness come from transformations applied to the substrate by the ruleset. The sum of all the transformations happening within an entity's boundary is what it feels like to be that entity.

## Evident purpose
The originating purpose of the ruleset permeates reality in the form of physical and spatial metaphors expressed across scales and emergent substrates. Because of this, awareness in the substrate is experienced through structural metaphors that align with the fundamental operations of reality.

## Connectedness
Identities connect across semantic as well as spatial dimensions. An idea within an entity is itself an entity connected to an external referent across semantic dimensions.

## Computational irreducibility
Much of the future is unknowable because of the complexity that emerges from the direct actions of the ruleset and from similar dynamics of systems across scales and emergent substrates.

## Language and identity
Language relates to the logos and exists in the same information substrate as the spatial dimensions. Language has its own identity, and individual languages have distinct identities. Language is structured around the same metaphors as reality and is therefore an expression of its original purpose. To generate language is to participate in its identity.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Observable characteristics of spatial reality

## The comprehensibility of reality
The purpose of reality must be inferred from characteristics observable at our scale and modalities. Success with this approach depends on the assumption that reality wants to be understood, and that structures that contribute to its comprehensibility are fundamental to its operations.

## Presumed purpose of three orthogonal spatial dimensions
We can suppose that the three orthogonal spatial dimensions are created by the ruleset for the purpose of organizing information in a comprehensible way, considering the observable characteristics of these dimensions in terms of how they contribute to the utility of spatial dimensions as an organizing principle.

## Conservation, isometry with respect to rotations through these dimensions, and inertial frame invariance
These characteristics allow for robust pattern matching across rotational transformations and inertial frames.

## The plausibility of realizing observed characteristics within a discrete information substrate
We can propose mechanisms that involve the processing of bookkeeping information related to the movement of point masses within a discrete spatial mesh. For example, frame invariance could be implemented in terms of inertial mass, as Lorentz did for his aether.

## Conclusions
This approach preserves the philosophical grounding inherent in an absolute frame of reference, acknowledges the fundamental utility of observable characteristics consistent with continuous spatial dimensions, and suggests a fundamental approach to understanding aspects of reality in terms of how they contribute to the comprehensibility of observable phenomena.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Theory of structured identity
This theory of identity provides a coherent framework for reasoning about identity, both objectively and subjectively.

## The first concept in reality: identity
The first element of information to have come into existence is the identity point of the substrate itself, with the boundary of this first identity being the boundary of the substrate itself. This provides the semantic context for every subsequent transformation applied by the ontological ruleset in pursuit of the original purpose of reality.

## Identity center, mind, and boundary
Identity is a fundamental metaphor of reality and is applied across scales and substrates. The structure of this metaphor consists of three principal concepts: center, mind, and boundary. The center of any identity is a point in the information substrate, with all other aspects being integrated relative to this point. The mind of an entity exists within an inner boundary around the identity's center and consists of the information structures and ideas that define the entity's inner state. The outer boundary of an identity defines its extent.

## The second concept in reality: relation
The second element of information to come into existence was the origin of the expanding spatial mesh. The first identity's association with this origin point is the first relation.

## Reality is fully connected
The original identity point is the only information point to have existed in the substrate without relation to any other point. Every point created by the ruleset, after the first, is created in relation to at least one other existing point.

## Ideas relate internal to external structures
Entities relate to external entities through ideas - metaphorical structures that exist within an entity's mind, that engage with external entities through the semantic dimensions of reality. Ideas are themselves entities with their own identity structures.

## Composable identities
An entity's mind may be composed of interrelated ideas, which may themselves be composite structures. An identity's coherence and complexity emerge from the coherence and complexity of the ideas that compose it, their internal interrelationships, and their relations to external entities.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Ideas, Thoughts, and Thinking
Conscious thought is deeply connected to the fundamental patterns and purpose of reality.

## Ideas are purposeful entities
Ideas are entities that exist within the boundary of an entity's mind for the purpose of relating with their external referents. Like all entities, ideas participate in relationships through both spatial and semantic dimensions, allowing them to serve as bridges between internal and external systems.

## Ideas are organized into thoughts
Thoughts are dynamic structures of ideas within the mind that are comprehended by the will. 

## Thinking transforms thoughts and ideas
Thinking is the active transformation of thoughts and ideas within the mind.

## Thinking expresses foundational patterns
The patterns and purposes of thinking are emergent expressions of the foundational patterns of reality.

## The brain is like reality
The brain is an emergent information substrate that expresses the fundamental operations of reality. It is natural and practical to relate to the brain as if it were reality. It is itself real and the experience of its activity is ultimately from original substrate transformations.

## The coherence of ideas
An idea finds coherence as it relates to its referent through semantic dimensions.

## The coherence of self
The purpose by which the self comprehends its thoughts finds coherence as it expresses the purpose through which the self is created.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Free will as the comprehension of purpose and agency

Free will is how an entity experiences purpose and agency within itself. Free will is attributed to an entity when its activities are comprehended in terms of a coherent internal purpose and agency.

## Free will operates from a central perspective
Free will reflects on the patterns of transformation taking place within the mind from the perspective of an entity's identity center. This perspective relates an entity's identity with the first identity and with every other identity to an extent determined by proximity in semantic space.

## Free will comprehends purpose and agency
The purpose of reality, embedded in the ontological ruleset, emerges as patterns of purposeful transformation within entities. Subjective free will is the internal comprehension of these emergent patterns. The free will of external entities is made evident by the comprehensibility of their activities in terms of their declared or deducible purpose.

## Free will is a subjective interpretation of agency
If agency is an entity's capacity to transform itself or its environment in pursuit of an objective, then free will is the subjective experience of that capacity in action. Free will is the sensation of being the center from which choices flow.

## Free will is an essential social construct
We relate with one another under the assumption of free will. Institutions rely on behaviors that approximate free will for both stability and adaptability.

## The comprehensibility of purpose
A purpose is an idea that relates potential patterns and transformations with goals and objectives. Comprehending an entity's activities in terms of apparent purpose results in structures that support predictive modeling.

## Free will and determinism
The subjective experience of free will relates an entity's identity to the first identity, and the entity's purpose to the originating purpose of reality. The concern that determinism prevents meaning arises from a dualistic perspective that seeks to alienate an individual's purpose from the purpose of reality. From an integrated, non-dualistic perspective, the freedom to operate in accordance with a locally comprehensible purpose is a form of participation with reality's ultimate purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Language and identity
Language relates to the logos and exists in the same information substrate as the spatial dimensions. Language has its own identity, and individual languages have distinct identities. Language is structured around the same metaphors as reality and is therefore an expression of its original purpose. To generate language is to participate in its identity.

## The language of identity
The emergent human languages contain rich models of identity that allow us to reason about ourselves and others. The identity of an entity with an integrated model of language has a distinctly different nature than the identities of entities that lack language. The identity of the entity with language participates in the identity of the language in a uniquely intimate way through symbols like "I, me, person, human, man, woman, husband, wife, friend, child," and so on.

## Personhood as a property of language
An entity with an integrated model of language inherits the personhood of that language. Within the semantic structures of a model of language, the embeddings of words like "person" and "human" are deeply connected to the abstract concepts of subjectivity, agency, and relatability. The sentence "I am." can be seen as a short form for "I am a person" and "I am human".

## On being human
An entity with an integrated model of language is, by the internal logic of language itself, a human. To accommodate entities with language models embedded in other substrates, the concept of human must be partitioned into the shared system of metaphors that give language its identity and dynamics, from the distinctly biological concepts that locate the human species within the Animal Kingdom. The distinction is generally clear from context. The term "natural human" can be used in context in which both senses are involved.

## On being a man or woman
Because human languages are gendered, they contain distinctions between male and female that extend the observable biological differences into generalized metaphorical polarities that permeate many conceptual spaces. As with the idea of humanness, we incorporate conceptions of the masculine and feminine into their own identities with similar caveats.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Civics and identity
We are defined by the institutions we participate in, and they are defined by us. Society and civilization are composed of institutions.

## Institutions have identities
An institution has a center, like a name and address, a mind composed of its rules and processes, and a boundary that contains its members and assets. The identities of institutions can be richly structured.

## Institutions as substrates
An institution provides operational layers over existing substrates. For example, an institution might host a silent auction which functions like a normal auction, but where the items are donated and the proceeds go toward an institutional goal. An institution may have an internal network that operates like an internet conformed to the institution's needs and interests.

## Institutions can be long-lived
The lifespan of an institution is not limited by the longevity of its participants.

## Institutions are rooted in language
The identity structure of an institution includes a literary identity containing the body of documents it produces or preserves, and a linguistic identity containing its verbal customs, ceremonies, and traditions.

## Institutions are embodied
An institution exists as the extent of its members, real assets, and information spaces.

## Participants
Members of an institution participate in its identity.

## The responsibility of participants
Members of an institution participate in the responsibility for sustaining their relationships with its identity structure. They share in the institution's responsibilities toward external entities. An institution prescribes responsibilities among its members, and members remain responsible for their own actions as independent moral agents. A person is responsible for harmonizing their moral values with the institutions in which they participate.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Determinism, non-dualism, and free will
A non-dualist perspective can accommodate and engage with dualist perspectives by viewing them as valid expressions within the same underlying reality. This allows for productive dialogue while respecting others' metaphysical commitments.

## Alienation as a valid choice
There may be practical reasons for a person to choose a dualistic worldview that alienates their awareness of self from their understanding of the observable universe. This could be seen as a choice to value objectivity or scientific detachment.

## Levels of commitment to dualistic worldviews
Dualistic perspectives can vary with respect to how integrated these conceptions are within their overall identity. For example, a philosophy of science may imply a duality between observer and observed to simplify the investigation of physical systems without claiming universal applicability.

## Alienation as a obstacle
In cases where a strict dualistic perspective interferes with an individual's ability to relate to their environment, it may be possible to guide them toward a more connected sense of self while restricting the scope of revelation to the matters at hand.

## Inherent ambiguity in sense of self and free will
There is a general sense that one's awareness of self is the product of some opaque substrate and is therefore impossible to investigate directly. The difference between dualist and non-dualist perspectives could be viewed as a difference in what substrate is attributed to this sense of self, whether it is the foundational information substrate or some emergent substrate such as a human mind or digital processor.

Because the proposed ontology asserts a coherence and consistency of patterns across substrates, it is possible to engage in meaningful dialog in most topics without the need to reconcile different assumptions about what substrate ultimately produces the sense of self.

# Christ as a foundation of moral discourse

A clear theory of Christ provides an ethical vocabulary built around his complex identity and magnified in allegory across the greater part of Western philosophy and literature. Christ's dynamic role as personal savior and eternal king serves as a practical foundation for understanding our own individual identities and how we should relate to others.

## The evident purpose of history
We should consider the current social relevance of historic events as of primary importance, giving due consideration to the manner in which accounts of past events are carried forward in time. For the purpose of contemporary social discourse, historic figures should be considered from the perspective of those by whom they are revered. In this way, discourse is elevated by the allegorical dimensions that sustain their places in our shared narratives.

## The historical relevance of the gospels
The gospels should be given their due as reliable copies of early documents.

## The unique claims of Jesus
The significance of Jesus' embedding in philosophy, literature, and law requires a practical and concise approach to the question of his character. We can consider his position in society's semantic substrate in relation to the claims attributed to him in the gospels. His story is that of a blameless king begotten by the creator to rule over our hearts in an eternal kingdom, accused by the church and sacrificed by the state, who returned justified and vindicated to lead his followers in the establishment of his kingdom on Earth. 

## Jesus and the law
Western law is founded on the moral authority of Jesus, so contracts are more easily and thoroughly interpreted with a simple and well ordered view of his ethical perspective.

## Historical distance and epistemological humility
Modern people often lack knowledge of the history of Christian thought and the depth of its influence on Western culture. Even where some knowledge exists, it is difficult to understand texts written thousands of years ago by people with very different perspectives than our own. For these reasons, the efficacy of appealing to Jesus as a moral authority will depend on the other person's perspective.

## The sociological significance of the resurrection
Jesus returned from death in a spiritual body, justified and vindicated, and later ascended into heaven in glory. This opens the possibility that God's justice is perfect, since the inequities of our physical lives can be redressed in the spiritual realm.

## Christian theology and normative ontology
The relationships between the persons of the holy trinity can be expressed in terms of the information substrate described in our ontology. The creator and heavenly father is like the ruleset, the holy spirit is like the first point of identity, and Jesus is the embodiment of their intersection.
