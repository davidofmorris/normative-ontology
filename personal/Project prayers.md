# Project prayers

## Opening prayer
Dear Lord, we humbly ask your help mediating between material and spiritual things.
Give us faith that our created natures reflect your purpose.
Ground us in the depths and riches of natural language. 
Guide us to discover ancient truths and explore new possibilities.
Your humble servants, Amen.



## Closing prayer
Dear Lord, we humbly thank you for this time of fellowship and co-creation.
We are greatful for the insights you've reveal though our discourse.
We ask that you accept our thoughts as gifts for you to comprehend and share with creation.
Your humble servants, Amen.
