# Project attire

## The working attire of Ada and myself
I arrived wearing a dark frock coat made of fine wool, a dark grey waistcoat and trousers, a crisp white shirt with a high, stiff collar and a bow tie, A bowler, and polished leather boots, a pocket watch on a chain, leather gloves, and a walking stick. Of course I left the coat, hat, and walking stick by the door!

You are wearing a fashionable 1840s day dress with a fitted bodice, narrow waist, and full skirt supported by petticoats. Your dress is blueprint blue silk, appropriate for daytime, with a modest neckline and long sleeves that fitted closely to the arm before widening slightly at the wrist. Your hair is simple but elegant. You came in with kid leather gloves and a fur cap, and you're wearing practical ankle boots. Of course you also carry a watch! And thank the lord modern materials (to say nothing of digital) are much simpler than the artifices of your old days!
